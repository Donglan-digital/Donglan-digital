<h2>🌱About Me: https://donglantechie.me/</h2> 
- I spent over a decade teaching Chinese to primary school students before transitioning into tech in 2024.<br>

- I’m currently learning:<br>
👍Python for web development and data manipulation<br>
👍HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js for building web applications<br>
- While I’m still on my journey to securing a hands-on role in tech, I’ve discovered a true passion for the field.<br>
